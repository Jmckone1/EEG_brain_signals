Understanding of EEG based brain signals and classification of the signals where an event takes place.

Abstract—EEG signals have seen an increase in usage within both research and the medical domain through the improvement of cheaper non-invasive neural signal collection, leading to a a higher rate of application development. Features extracted vary between temporal, spectral, and statistical information; which can then be applied in a number of manners, producing results dependent upon the strengths of a given machine learning architecture. This report shows a comparative study of implementations within those existing domains which make use of machine learning and deep learning as an EEG analysis and classiﬁcation technique, alongside similar signal processing problems.

Just testing some changes.
